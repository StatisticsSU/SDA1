x = rexp(n, rate = lambda) # simulate
mean(x) # mean of the simulations, should be close to E(X) = 1/lambda = 1/3

# Compute probability function at x = 0.5

# Compute probability P(X <= 0.5)
pexp(0.5, rate = lambda)

# Compute 90% quantile

# Let's check that mean of the simulated values becomes closer to true E(X) = 1/lambda 
# as we add more and more simulated values from our n = 10000 values.
